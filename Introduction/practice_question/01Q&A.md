## Conceptual Questions

1. **What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?**

   * **JDK**: Java Development Kit; used for developing and compiling Java programs.
   * **JRE**: Java Runtime Environment; contains JVM and libraries to run Java programs.
   * **JVM**: Java Virtual Machine; executes bytecode and provides platform independence.

2. **Why is Java called platform-independent?**

   * Java programs are compiled into **bytecode**, which can run on any system with a compatible JVM.

3. **What are the main memory areas of the JVM and their purposes?**

   * **Heap**: Stores objects.
   * **Stack**: Stores method call frames.
   * **Method Area**: Stores class-level information.

4. **Explain the meaning of bytecode and its role in Javaâ€™s portability.**

   * Bytecode is a **platform-independent intermediate code** generated by the Java compiler. JVM interprets bytecode on any OS, enabling portability.

5. **List three key features of Java and briefly explain each.**

   * **Object-Oriented**: Organizes code using classes and objects.
   * **Platform Independent**: Write once, run anywhere using bytecode and JVM.
   * **Robust and Secure**: Strong memory management, exception handling, and security features.

## True/False Questions

1. The JVM compiles `.java` files into machine code. **False** (JVM executes bytecode, not `.java` files)
2. The `javac` command generates `.class` files. **True**
3. Java is both object-oriented and platform-independent. **True**

## Practical Questions

1. **Write a command to compile a file named `Demo.java`.**

```cmd
javac Demo.java
```

2. **Write a command to run the compiled `Demo.class` file using JVM.**

```cmd
java Demo
```

3. **If a class file is created on Windows, can it run on Linux? Explain why.**

* **Yes.** The `.class` file contains bytecode which is platform-independent. Any system with a compatible JVM can execute it.
