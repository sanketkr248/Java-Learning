# Introduction to Java

Java is a **high-level, platform-independent programming language** created by Sun Microsystems. It is widely used for web, desktop, and mobile applications.

## Key Components

* **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Needed to write and compile Java programs.
* **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Needed to run Java programs; contains JVM and libraries.
* **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes Java bytecode, manages memory, and ensures platform independence.

## How Java Works

1. Write code in a `.java` file.
2. Compile with `javac` ‚Üí produces a `.class` file (bytecode).
3. Run with `java` ‚Üí JVM executes the bytecode on any platform.

## üöÄ Key Features of Java

* Object-Oriented
* Platform Independent
* Robust and Secure
* Multithreaded
* High Performance (with JIT compiler)

## üñ•Ô∏è JVM Memory Overview

* **Heap**: Stores objects.
* **Stack**: Stores method call frames.
* **Method Area**: Stores class-level information.

## üíª Quick Command Example

```cmd
javac Hello.java   # Compiles Hello.java to Hello.class
java Hello         # Runs the program using JVM
```

Java ensures **write once, run anywhere** through its platform-independent bytecode executed by the JVM.
