# Java Learning Journey by Sanket K.

Welcome to my **Java learning repository**!  

I am starting my journey to learn **Java programming** from scratch and documenting everything I learn here. This repository will serve as a reference for my progress and also help others who are starting with Java.

## üéØ Goals

My goals for learning Java include:

- Mastering **core Java concepts**: syntax, data types, operators, control statements.  
- Understanding **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.  
- Learning **exception handling** to write robust and error-free code.  
- Exploring **multithreading** and concurrency for efficient program execution.  
- Working with **file handling** and I/O operations.  
- Learning **collections framework**: List, Set, Map, and their implementations.  
- Understanding **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)** to connect and interact with databases.  
- Exploring **Java 8+ features** like Streams, Lambda expressions, and functional programming.  
- Building **small projects** to reinforce practical knowledge.

## üìù How to Use

- Browse through the Markdown files to see notes and code examples.
- Try out the exercises and programs on your own system.
- Refer to the explanations to understand Java concepts in detail.

## üí° Notes

- All code examples are written in **Java 7+ compatible syntax**.
- All theoretical concepts are documented in **Markdown files** for easy reference.
- This is a personal learning journey, so updates will be added regularly as I progress.
